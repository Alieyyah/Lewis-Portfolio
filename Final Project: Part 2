# User Research Overview
During the development of my story board I was able to recieve feedback from through of my colleagues.The first colleague from undergrad, who currently works in HR, the second colleauge is another heinz student, and 
is a long time friend who works as a Businness Devevlopment Manager. It is also imperative to note, that my storyboard has progressed overtime; my visulizations started out as bar gragphs and then transitioned into line graphs due to the feedback recieved. 

# User Research Protocol
I spoke to all three colleagues via telephone over the course of the past week and ask them three very short questons:
1. From the current stage of the draft, what do you see?
2. Is the story clear?
3. How could one improve this visulaization to enhance the development of the story?

# Results from User Research

Interview from colleague from Undergrad:
Quesustion: From the current stage of the draft, what do you see?
Colleague: It is difficult to tell. Right now I see learge values of numbers represented for the bars, what does that mean?
Alieyyah: Currenlty, I am trying to depict the change of the development of symptoms of anxiety during the pandemic over the course of 12 weeks. Right now the values in the bars represent the population.
Colleague: I think you should represent the development of symptoms into percentages. Clean the data to make that adjustment.
Question: Is the story clear?
Colleague: I think, once you turn the population into percentages you will be able to see a a clear trend of development of anxiety symtpoms in age groups overtime. 
Alieyyah: Thank you, I take it that this would be your suggetion as the imporvment to enhance the story.
Colleague: Yes, and continue to play aroudn with cluster and bar graphs to see if that is a clear way to tell the story.

# Reflection from interview with collegague from undergrad:
Overall, I thought his feedback was helpful consiering I was lost, with the direction of how to portray the data. I was not sure how make the data clear in concise without misconstruding the data to fit a narrative. Cleaning the data to represent the percentage of the population for a particular age group allowed me to do so in a way that did not compromise the data. 

# Interview two: colleague in the MSPPM program at Heinz College
Question: From the current stage of the draft, what do you see?
Colleague: Right now I see percentages that represent the population of various ages groups, but what is your ultimate purpose or the story you are trying to tell?
Alieyyah: I am currenlty exploring the the development of symptoms of anxiety during the pandemic over a 12 week period.
Colleague: What visisulzation helps to portary trends over time?
Alieyyah: I guess line graphs do that, but I didn't consider to use it because of I was measuring the percentages of the development of anxiety symptoms.
Question: How could one improve this visulaization to enhance the development of the story?
Colleague: Try to develop line graphs and think about highlighting the main takeawy that you want the audience to walkaway with in orderfor the story to be clear. 

# Reflection from Interview with colleague from Heinz:
The interview was helpful and it made think about what is the main idea from each measurment of the panemidc and its impact on anxiety to ensure that it connecs with the call to action.

# Interview three: Long time friend who is an Businness Devevlopment Manager:
It is imperative to note that this friend was able to see the feedback that was implemented from the first two interview
Question: From the current stage of the draft, what do you see?
Colleague: I can tell that you meauring the development the anxiety symtpoms during the pandemic. How many weeks are you measuring/
Alieyyah: Out of the 12 weeks I am measuring three: week 1, week 6, and week 12. 
Question: Is the story clear?
Colleague: To me the trend is not super clear in a line graph format. I think using a cluster bar graph with the age group resprenting the cluster that is measured rather the amount of sysmptoms will help to develop the trend overtime. I also think color coordinating the clusters would be helpful. You don't have to take my advice but, I think bar graphs are easier to read. 
Alieyyah: That is an interesting perspective, I had another colleague not really suggest changing the bars and another wo recommend using the line graph. I will continue to play around with the visulaizaton, to see which one depcits the story in a clear and concise manner. 
Question: How could one improve this visulaization to enhance the development of the story?#
Colleague, I think you could improve the by chaning the graph type, adding clear title of the stitnct weeks to the graphs, and make sure the legend is clear to the audience.

# Reflection from Interview:
Overall, I thought this colleague brought up valid points. I felt like I was back to the drawing board with deciding the best graph to depct the trend over time. 

# Next Steps
After thorugh reflection from feedback, I beleive it is essential for me to switch my visulization into tableeau to allow more access to features that will highlight data that dinsguishes the trend. I also think that the feedback to incoporate the percentage of the population, a line graph to show trend, highlght the ages is key to ensuring my sotry is told with fiedliety. Over the course of the next week, I need to refine the visulization to ensure the audience is able to depeict the main idea and the story together, with out asking questions.
