# Intended Audience
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was imperative to explore the development of anxiety symptoms for American Citizens of various ages to understand anxiety development. When developing the project outline and final product, this project was geared for a diverse population as the pandemic has influenced people's lives globally. Whether you are young or old, the goal is to provide a story and insight into how the pandemic increased adults' anxiety in the United States. Adults from other countries could find this information useful as well. The ultimate goal is to allow the audience to reflect on the data for their particular age range and think about their anxiety symptoms that one may have experienced during the pandemic, and develop a self-care routine to cope. 

# Crafting The Story
I found this process relatively challenging as I was working towards crafting a story to develop symptoms of anxiety during the pandemic. During the Desing and project outline phase, I knew I wanted to analyze age as a variable. At each age of one's adult, our bodies respond to various situations differently.  During the Desing phase, I had created four graphs via flourish platform comparing the various level of the development of anxiety such as not at all, several days, more than half the days, and nearly every day for seven age groups. Based on the user feedback, I realized that my data was not depicting anxiety over 12 weeks during the pandemic. Thus, I chose to condense the range of the ages into four categories: 18-39, 40-59, 60-79, and 80-above. Altering the age groups required me to clean the data and do some new calculations of the percentages of the populations who have developed symptoms each week. 

I used excel to reclean the data. I created four sheets for each of the four new categories. I created two tables. The first table served as the sum of the population for each age group and their level of development of anxiety; the second table consists of calculations for the percent of the population with developed anxiety symptoms throughout the 12 weeks during the pandemic from April 23rd-July 21st. An example of the new clean data is below:

Once the data tables are cleaned, I was able to begin to redesign of the visualization. During Part two of the User research, I received some feed to use bar charts and received feedback to keep the line graphs. I made the executive decision to create four line graphs to analyze the development of anxiety symptoms for each age group to compare over the 12 weeks of the pandemic. I began to use flourish but experienced some formatting issues with the graph in terms of the lines' location. Thus, I thought it was best to make the graphs in excel to have more control of manipulating the data to ensure it was displaying correctly. To ensure the graphs were clear and concise, I removed the metrics on the y-axis, added data labels to each point, picked colors, and titles to the chart and the x-axis.
Regarding picking a color, I wanted to be sure about developing symptoms every day, not useful. Thus I used the color red. I chose the color blue to develop symptoms more than half the days as it often represents a stabilizing color. Development of anxiety more than half the days of the week is not horrible, but it is also not great as having no symptoms at all, which in that case, I would have used green. 

Finally, I thought it was imperative to address the triggers of anxiety. It could have been beneficial to list the triggers by their rankings in a list, but I decided to use a treemap to display the hierarchal order of the rankings of the symptoms of the triggers of anxiety. Finally, regarding the call to action, various studies and new articles supported the development of self-care routines. Various sources that were consulted provided many approaches to develop a self-care routine. I decided to use a table format so that the audience can see that there are various dimensions of wellness essential to one's health. It provided clear examples of self-care activities that will allow them to begin to think or develop one of their own.
