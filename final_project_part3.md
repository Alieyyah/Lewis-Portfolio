# Intended Audience
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was imperative to explore the development of anxiety symptoms for American Citizens of various ages to understand the development of anxiety. When developing the project outline and final product, this project was geared for a diverse population as the pandemic has influenced people's lives globally. Whether you are young or old, the goal is to provide a story and insight into how the pandemic increased adults' anxiety in the United States. Adults from other countries could find this information useful as well. The ultimate goal is to allow the audience to reflect on the data for their particular age range and think about their anxiety symptoms that one may have experienced during the pandemic and how they could develop a self-care routine to assist with coping. 

# Crafting The Story
I found this process relatively challenging as I working towards crafting a story for the development of symptoms of anxiety during the pandemic. During the Desing and project outline phase, I knew I wanted to analzye age as a variable, becuase at each eage of one's adult, our boudies responds to various situtions differenlty.  During the Desing phase I had originally created four graphs via flourish platform comparing the various level of the development of anxiety such as not at all, several days, more than half the days, and nearly every day for seven age groups. Based on the user feedback, I was able to realize that my data was not depeicting the development of anxety over the course of 12 weeks during the pandemic. Thus, I chose to condese the range of the ages into four categories: 18-39, 40-59, 60-79, and 80-above. Altering the age groups required me to cleand the data and to do some new calcuations of the percentages of the populations who have developed symtpoms during each week. 

I used excel to reclean the data. I created four sheets for each of the four new categories. I created two tables, the first table surved as the sum of the populuation for each age group and their level of development of anxiety; the second table consit of calcuations for the percent of the population that has development symptoms of anxieity over the course of the 12 week period during the pandemic from April 23rd-July 21st. Example of the new clean data is below:
