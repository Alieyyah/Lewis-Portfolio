# Lewis-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories With Data Class at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
# About me
I am Alieyyah J. Lewis (she/her/hers), and I am a second-year graduate student studying Public Policy and Management on the Washington, D.C. track at Carnegie Mellon University. The track is a  highly selective program that integrates graduate coursework in public policy, management, technology, and analytics with a two-semester fellowship based in Washington, D.C., during the second year of study. I am currently serving as a Policy Fellow for DC Appleseed Law and Justice Center. Upon completing my degree in May 2021, I plan to pursue a career in education policy and advocacy within Federal Education Agencies, State Education Agencies, or Local Education Agencies. 
# What I hope to learn
Due to my previous experiences as an educator and as an alumna of Teach For America (TFA), I have worked with my students, families, administrators, community partners, and TFA to close the achievement gap. I  believe advocacy is the first step to eliminate injustice with the support of data.  I hope and to intertwine both disciplines of public policy and data analysis to ensure all students are receiving an equitable education. Through this course, I am looking forward to developing strong data visualization skills to compliment my ability to analyze data to ensure policymakers and stakeholders understand the compelling stories of educational inequities across the United States.

# Government Finances
The data visualization below analyzes 35 countries' debt-to-GDP ratios to measure the percentage of gross debt (liabilities) between 1995 and 2019. The 24-year analysis of debt-to-GDP ratios allows for the measurement of government financial sustainability or lack of sustainability over time.
