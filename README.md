# Lewis-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories With Data Class at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
# About me
I am Alieyyah J. Lewis (she/her/hers), and I am a second-year graduate student studying Public Policy and Management on the Washington, D.C. track at Carnegie Mellon University. The track is a  highly selective program that integrates graduate coursework in public policy, management, technology, and analytics with a two-semester fellowship based in Washington, D.C., during the second year of study. I am currently serving as a Policy Fellow for DC Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. Upon completing my degree in May 2021, I plan to pursue a career in education policy and advocacy within Federal Education Agencies, State Education Agencies, or Local Education Agencies. 
# What I hope to learn
Due to my previous experiences as an educator and as an alumna of Teach For America (TFA), I have worked with my students, families, administrators, community partners, and TFA to close the achievement gap. I  believe advocacy is the first step to eliminate injustice with the support of data.  I hope and to intertwine both disciplines of public policy and data analysis to ensure all students are receiving an equitable education. Through this course, I am looking forward to developing strong data visualization skills to compliment my ability to analyze data to ensure policymakers and stakeholders understand the compelling stories of educational inequities across the United States.

# Government Finances
The data visualization below analyzes 35 countries' debt-to-GDP ratios to measure the percentage of gross debt (liabilities) between 1995 and 2019. The 24-year analysis of debt-to-GDP ratios allows for the measurement of government financial sustainability or lack of sustainability over time.

# Global Governments Debt Analysis per Year: Gridlines v. Area Chart v. Pie Chart with Row Filter
As previously mentioned, the Global Governments Debt Analysis per Year's objective is to depict the financial story of 35 countries' debt-to-GDP ratios to measure liabilities over 24 years (1995-2019). During that period, governments accumulate debt such as loans, insurances, pensions, and accounts payable. When a government's expenses exceed its revenue, then the government will experience an economic deficit. Using the Gridline graph establishes the opportunity to compare all 35 countries' debt-to-GDP ratios. The Gridlines also depicts the trend of each of the countries' government liabilities over the 24 years.  For example, Japan began with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 94.74 in 1995. Throughout the 24 years, Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 238.73 in 2018. Other trends, such as decreased debt-to-ratio or a steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio, are visually depicted through the gridlines chart. 

An area chart is also an effet data visualization. To further enhance the analysis or story of debt-to-GDP ratio increasing, decreasing, or remain constant over the 24 years. The gridline is excellent for depicting continuous data, but the area chart allows the audience to depict change over time with the shading in the data area. Referring back to the Japan example, with the area chart, one can determine that the government's liabilities have increased over time, without hovering over the graph to seek the specific value for the debt-to-GDP ratio. 

Finally, I was intrigued to analyze a pie chart's effectiveness to depict the debt-to-GDP ratio change over time.   With the pie chart presented above, one can decipher the debt-to-GDP ratio change as the values are listed in the part-to-whole. The pie chart lacks the clarity of the trend of time that the area chart or the gridline chart can provide. Due to various use of colors and slices, the pie chart does allow the audience to visually analyze each year clearly and concisely as each part-to-whole represents a year of the 24-year analysis. 

# UNICEF Redesign:Can TV solve the remote-learning delimma?
 As a former educator and advocate of equitable education policies, I am concerned about how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect students' ability to learn during the 2020-2021 academic year. UNICEF recently published global analysis of the potential reach of remote learning policies.  With the support of data from UNESCO-UNICEF-World Bank Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures (June-July 2020), household microdata from sources like Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and  Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), UNICEF was able to analyze the potential reach of remote learning platforms such as the internet, radio, and television for millions of children who lack access to resources across continents.  Below is UNICEF's visualization output of analysis.

UNICEF's data and visulization objective is to conlcude that TV-based remote learning polices has the poential to reach the greatest proportion of students globally as education stakeholders continue to navigate the pandemic. After extracing the data and conducting a personal analysis, I concur that the data concludes TV-based remote learning policies has the potential to reach the masses as overall analysis, but if one conducts a geogrpahic analysis one may conclude that prefered remote learning policies may differ based upon geogrpahic regions. Thus, it was imperative for my personal analysis to creat sketch redesigns  that told the story of golbal remote learning policies via rating of preferences in clear and concise manner that would still allow for a compartive analysis of the three remote learning platform preferences (internet, radio, and televison). 

# Sketches of UNICEF Redesign & Feedback

I completed teh sketching process in two phases. The first phase was an intial rough draft to allow me to brainstorm how I can enhance the elements of the orignial visulization and create a clear narrative of the sotry. Thus I developed a pie chart. 

# Proect Proposal

My first initial thought was to sketch a pice chart to visualize the remote learning policies as a pie chart. The original data chose to visualize the preference rating for more intent, radio, and television wit percentages. As I began to draw the sketches, I noticed that the ratings were not equal to 100 between the three platforms for remote learning policies. Thus, I knew I must shift my focus and think of a chart that would be a better design for this particular data set. Before I shifted gears, I sought feedback from two colleagues.  Colleagues shared that it was slightly difficult to describe what the visualization conveyed with the pie chart. The potential reach data would not sum up to the whole (100) as they are ratings and not percentage, which can be misleading especially when comparing across multpiple regions. Thus, both colleagues recommend for me to rethink the design and sketch. One colleague provided the specific feedback of trying to redesign the visualization with a bar chart.

The cluster bar chart allows the visulizations to be more effective.It is more imformative and emotive.  The cluster bar chart allows the viewer to do a comparative analysis, while with ease determine that TV based remote learning policies.

# Final UNICEF Redesign:Can TV solve the remote-learning delimma?
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3828692" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3828692/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I chose to use Flourish for the final output of the visualization, which would allow for a comparative analysis of rated remote learning police/ platforms across regions. I moved the continents' label on the Y-axis and labeled the X-axis with the potential ratings rather than the percentages. I also added a legend at the top and changed the chart title. With new visualization, you can also filter by virtual learning platform to do an individual analysis. Overall, I still wanted to tell the story that, according to the data, that overall potential reach rating for TV is the greatest. However, possible reach varies across regions, and the data does not explain why. Further analysis would need to be conducted.
