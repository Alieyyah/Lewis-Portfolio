# UNICEF Redesign:Can TV solve the remote-learning delimma?
 As a former educator and advocate of equitable education policies, I am concerned about how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect students' ability to learn during the 2020-2021 academic year. UNICEF recently published global analysis of the potential reach of remote learning policies.  With the support of data from UNESCO-UNICEF-World Bank Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures (June-July 2020), household microdata from sources like Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and  Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), UNICEF was able to analyze the potential reach of remote learning platforms such as the internet, radio, and television for millions of children who lack access to resources across continents.  Below is UNICEF's visualization output of analysis.

UNICEF's data and visulization objective is to conlcude that TV-based remote learning polices has the poential to reach the greatest proportion of students globally as education stakeholders continue to navigate the pandemic. After extracing the data and conducting a personal analysis, I concur that the data concludes TV-based remote learning policies has the potential to reach the masses as overall analysis, but if one conducts a geogrpahic analysis one may conclude that prefered remote learning policies may differ based upon geogrpahic regions. Thus, it was imperative for my personal analysis to creat sketch redesigns  that told the story of golbal remote learning policies via rating of preferences in clear and concise manner that would still allow for a compartive analysis of the three remote learning platform preferences (internet, radio, and televison). 

# Sketches of UNICEF Redesign & Feedback

I completed teh sketching process in two phases. The first phase was an intial rough draft to allow me to brainstorm how I can enhance the elements of the orignial visulization and create a clear narrative of the sotry. Thus I developed a pie chart.

My first initial thought was to sketch a pice chart to visualize the remote learning policies as a pie chart. The original data chose to visualize the preference rating for more intent, radio, and television wit percentages. As I began to draw the sketches, I noticed that the ratings were not equal to 100 between the three platforms for remote learning policies. Thus, I knew I must shift my focus and think of a chart that would be a better design for this particular data set. Before I shifted gears, I sought feedback from two colleagues.  Colleagues shared that it was slightly difficult to describe what the visualization conveyed with the pie chart. The potential reach data would not sum up to the whole (100) as they are ratings and not percentage, which can be misleading especially when comparing across multpiple regions. Thus, both colleagues recommend for me to rethink the design and sketch. One colleague provided the specific feedback of trying to redesign the visualization with a bar chart.

The cluster bar chart allows the visulizations to be more effective.It is more imformative and emotive.  The cluster bar chart allows the viewer to do a comparative analysis, while with ease determine that TV based remote learning policies.

# Final UNICEF Redesign:Can TV solve the remote-learning delimma?

I chose to use Flourish for the final output of the visualization, which would allow for a comparative analysis of rated remote learning police/ platforms across regions. I moved the continents' label on the Y-axis and labeled the X-axis with the potential ratings rather than the percentages. I also added a legend at the top and changed the chart title. With new visualization, you can also filter by virtual learning platform to do an individual analysis. Overall, I still wanted to tell the story that, according to the data, that overall potential reach rating for TV is the greatest. However, possible reach varies across regions, and the data does not explain why. Further analysis would need to be conducted.
